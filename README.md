# XenServer Guest VM Templates
This REPO is conatins XenServer Guest VM Templates: built, tested, provided, and
updated (as needed) by the XenServer Open Source Community.


# Important to Note!
The Guest VM Templates stored here are in no way supported NOR maintained by
Citrix Systems, LLC (or its affiliates). These are intended for TEST only.


# Installing a Template
Each template is basically a BASH script, however the BASH declaration has been
removed as so one, by installing a template, acknowledges any LICENSE, README,
or EULA stored here.


* Copy one or more desired templates to your XenServer
* Gain access to the CLI of the XenServer
* Execute: sh <name-of-template>.sh to install

That's it!
